* Make a fun game!
** Performance
*** The game must run at a consistent frame rate at all times, 60 fps would be preferable.
** Level Editor
*** There must be an easy way of creating levels as well as enemy flight and attack patterns.
**** Enemies should follow a specific path then exit the screen.  Enemies will often follow the same path so it is necessary that these paths can be reused.
**** Enemies should be able to perform specific actions along the path they follow.
***** Enemies should be able to shoot different types of bullets.
***** The creator should be able to set the (at least initial) speed that the enemy travels along the line.
***** [#C] The enemy should be able to change speeds along the line.
***** There will likely be additional actions that will need to be implemented.

* Risks
** The player finger must track the player sprite very closely or the player will get killed unfairly  - 
*** DONE Resolution - build a prototype to determine if this will be a showstopper
