** Non-functional Requirements
*** Performance
**** The game must run at a consistent frame rate at all times, 60 fps would be preferable, but 30 or 40 should be fine.

**** The game must be able to shutdown and save state quickly.
***** TODO Look to see if Apple has regulations on shutdown time. 	   :TBD:
***** The shutdown needs to happen as quickly as possible.  Target of under a second.
***** On shutdown, if game is in progress [[Quicksave][Quicksave]].
*** Stability
**** The game should ship with no known crashes.
**** If there are smaller bugs found a judgement call should be made whether they should be fixed before sending to store.
