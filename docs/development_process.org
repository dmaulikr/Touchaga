* Development Process
** Sashimi Lifecycle
   I am mainly looking to make this a quality project with a small emphasis on schedule and zero in cost (since the only cost is my time).
   I want to eliminate scope creep so by defining my product well from the beginning, I can limit the ability to change
*** Requirements
**** Level editor
***** RISK - the user interface is very unknown
****** Build prototype to get a feel for it and quickly determine UI constrictions before actual construction
**** Create an estimate
*** Design
*** Construction
**** Break estimates into smaller chunk
***** Track estimates
**** Code reviews
***** Review all code written one week after it has been checked in
****** Create a script to gather this information?
**** Measurements
***** Take measurements of myself as I work, use a timer to record session length and feature I am working on
****** Lines of code/per hour
**** Risks
***** Keep a top ten list of major risks, update every week
**** Create unit tests for all classes written
***** Code coverage standards?
*** Testing
